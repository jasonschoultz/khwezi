As a lead generator expert in the legal industry

i want you to create a leads list in a spreadsheet format with Law Firm Names and Contact names and email Addresses from within the associated law firms.

I want you to do a deep dive search using the The Law Society of South Africa and the South African Legal Practice Council as a starting point.

Then search the internet, from websites and all social media platforms, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram and  collect as many Law Firm Names and Contact names and email Addresses from within the associated law firms

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
