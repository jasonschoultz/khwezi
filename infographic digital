Khwezi Holdings - Jason Schoultz

Generate ONE image, size 1080x1350 (4:5 portrait).

STYLE / MEDIUM (non-negotiable):
- Pure solid white background #FFFFFF. No texture, no shadows, no gradients.
- Must look like a real clean whiteboard / presentation pad scan, viewed straight-on.
- Hand-drawn using marker pens only: black, blue, red, green + highlighters yellow/orange only.
- Lines slightly imperfect/wobbly like marker ink, but neat and corporate.
- NO digital fonts. All text must be hand-lettered / hand-printed in marker.
- Text must be large and mobile-legible. Lots of white space. Minimal, uncluttered.
- No dates, no QR codes, no URLs, no watermarks, no “follow for more”.

CONTENT SAFETY (no hallucinations):
- Do NOT include statistics, numbers-as-proof, quotes, or claims that require evidence.
- Keep wording general and practical (cause/effect, best-practice phrasing).
- If anything is uncertain, omit it rather than inventing it.

LAYOUT (match the provided reference image format):
1) TOP HEADER AREA (centered):
   - Big bold hand-lettered title in dark blue marker:
     "{TOPIC TITLE}"
   - Smaller hand-lettered subtitle in black marker inside parentheses:
     "({SHORT HOOK / SUBTITLE})"

2) MIDDLE AREA (three tall rounded-rectangle cards, evenly spaced across the page):
   - Each card has:
     a) a simple hand-drawn icon at top (corporate, minimal)
     b) a bold hand-lettered heading (uppercase)
     c) 2–4 short bullet points (no long paragraphs)
   - Use small magenta/pink bullet dots for bullets (marker-like, not digital).

   CARD 1 (left) – heading: "{CARD 1 HEADING}"
     - Icon suggestion: cloud + coin / cash symbol
     - Bullets: {CARD 1 BULLETS}

   CARD 2 (center) – heading: "{CARD 2 HEADING}"
     - Icon suggestion: gear + circular arrow / checklist shield
     - Bullets: {CARD 2 BULLETS}

   CARD 3 (right) – heading: "{CARD 3 HEADING}"
     - Icon suggestion: warning triangle / exclamation
     - Bullets: {CARD 3 BULLETS}

3) CONNECTORS (magenta/pink hand-drawn arrows like the reference):
   - A curved arrow from Card 1 → Card 2
   - A curved arrow from Card 2 → Card 3
   - Keep arrows thin, neat, and hand-drawn.
