Generate ONE image (1080x1350, 4:5) of a corporate, hand-drawn infographic on a pure white background (#FFFFFF) that looks like a real whiteboard or clean presentation pad, viewed straight-on (like a clean scan).

CRITICAL RULES (Must follow)

Do NOT hallucinate. Do not invent facts, statistics, quotes, or “proof points.”

If you are not sure about any claim, wording, or instruction, ASK clarifying questions BEFORE generating the image.

Follow the layout and style rules exactly. If there is a conflict, ask a clarifying question.

Crucial Style Instructions

Medium: Must look like a real whiteboard / clean presentation pad, but NOT like a notebook photo.

No desk, no camera angle, no page curl, no spiral binding, no paper texture, no shadows.

Background must be solid pure white.

Texture: All elements must look drawn by hand using:

Marker pens: black, blue, red, green

Highlighters: yellow / orange only

Lines should be slightly imperfect/wobbly with marker ink texture, but neat and corporate.

No Digital Fonts: All headings, text, bullets must be handwritten / hand-printed in marker.

Text must be large and legible for mobile.

Design Feel: Corporate, clean, minimal, with lots of white space.

Use multi-coloured markers for emphasis, but keep it restrained (not messy).

No dates anywhere on the image.

No QR codes, URLs, watermarks, or “follow for more” CTAs.
